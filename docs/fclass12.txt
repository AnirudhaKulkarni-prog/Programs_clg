1.We learnt about Stateful and Stateless Widget.
2.We need to change the width and height of Container dynamically,for that we use MediaQuery class.
3.MediaQuery finds out the size of any mobile and helps us in setting height and width.
4.If we want to make changes to something that is already created at run time Stateless Widget is of no use,
Here StateFullWidget comes into picture.
5.Any change(change of state) at runtime to be noticed by the widget(where change is visible) we use setState() function.
6.setState() updates all the widgets that change at runtime.
7.We also learnt about printing the output on the App which can be possible due setState() function.
