1.Our Aim today is to Build our First App with complete UI design.
2.We can output our data(code) on the console,network,Mobile App etc.
3.To output on console we use print(),if on network we use send() and if to be printed on the App then Text function is used 
4.Text function has properties in the form of key and values,runApp() launches the App,MaterialApp() uses Material DEsign to beautify the App
main()
{
  var x=Text("Hello",textDirection:TextDirection.ltr,textAlign:TextAlign.center,);

  var design=MaterialApp(home:x,);


  runApp(design);


}
5.Don't write everything in main function use different fuctions.
main()
{
  runApp(myApp());
}
myApp()
{
  var x=Text("Hello",textDirection:TextDirection.ltr,textAlign:TextAlign.center,);
  var design=MaterialApp(home:x,);
  return design;
}
6.Also we can use different files to write the code and later import the files that are required.
7.MaterialApp() uses home property which defines the complete UI of the Home page,also it includes other properties that help to remove the debug tag etc

eg:- var design=MaterialApp(home:myhome,debugShowCheckedModeBanner:false ,);

8.Scaffold is a class that gives us the pre-designed version of App page.Properties like AppBar,body, etc provide look and feel.
eg:-  var myhome=Scaffold(appBar:myAppBar ,body:Center(child:x,),backgroundColor:Colors.white ,);
9.Appbar class provides us with properties like title,leading and actions that can be fitted into our App bar.
eg:- var myAppBar=AppBar(title:mytext,
                  backgroundColor:Colors.blueAccent,
                  leading:MyImage,
                  actions: <Widget>[MyEmailButton,MyCalButton,
                  ],);
8.Icon class provides different types of Icons to the App,some perform actions(events) others are just images

eg:-
     var myicon1=Icon(Icons.email);
9.IconButton class with the help of property like onpressed provides functionality to the button.
eg:-
    var MyEmailButton=IconButton(icon: myicon1, onPressed: press1);
    press1()
  {
    print("Someone clicked on email....");
  }

10.actions property performs a list of Actions.

11.Image class is used to display an image.To use an image from the web we can use network() method of Image class.It also contains other properties like width,height etc

eg:-var MyImage=Image.network(url,width: double.infinity,height: double.infinity,);
