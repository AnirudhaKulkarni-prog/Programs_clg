Dart:-
1.Online Editor DartPad can be used to practice dart.
2.Creation of variables to store data.Also mention the data type like int,String,float etc.
3.String is depicted by a single/double quote.
4."var" keyword is used to store variable of any datatype(dynamically).
5.To know the data type of the variable at run type we use "variable.runtimeType"
6.List datatype is like an array can store many values.
7.To make the list store values of only one datatype use "List<int> x=[3,4,5]".Lists are mutable.
8.We use index(0,1,2....) to access elements of list but in map data type each element can be given a variable name of our own instead of (0,1,2,3..).Map datatype contains key value pairs.
9.Example of map:-var x={"id":1,"email":"v@lw.com","remarks":"good",}
10.Accessing map elements:-x["id"]=1
11.Maps are prefered over lists.

Flutter:-
1.Create app test3 through cmd and load it in VScode.
2.Always save your .dart file in lib folder.
3.Google developed a system called Material Design in 2014 to improve your UI.
4.Flutter uses by default uses Material design.
5.runApp() function consists of all th UI.
6.MaterialApp() function is responsible for designing the home page.
7.Use of MaterialApp():-
    main()
    {
	runApp(MaterialApp(
	     home:Center(
		child:Text("Hi"),
		),
	      ));
     }
8.Text fuction is used to print content on the page.If the content needs to be in the Center then it should be present in the Center() function.
9.From the Above example we can infer that dart uses map datatype extensively.
