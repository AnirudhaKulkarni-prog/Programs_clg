We learnt about API,JSON and python.
The server-side program built in either python,ruby,java etc provides a interface between client and server
json format is a notation in which server sends the data to the client for getting the required data.
Data in json is in curlybraces in which key,value pairs are used.
We need to import json in the python server-side python program.
On client-side,we use json parsing ,to extract data from json format we use jsonDecode().
The extracted data is in the form map datatype.
