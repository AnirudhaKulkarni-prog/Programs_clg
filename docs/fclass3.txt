1.Today we discuss the body property of Scaffold,body as a key can be assigned only one function.
  eg:-  body:Center(child: mybody)

2.Container() function internally creates a boundary with properties width,height etc to define it's size.
3.Using Colors function we can know how much space the Container covers by default(usually complete body).
  eg:-  var mybody=Container(
    width:100,
    height:100,
    child:Text(
      "Hello",
      style: TextStyle(color:Colors.deepPurple),),
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      color:Colors.blue,
    ),
  );
        
4.A function inside another function should be given a key as child.
5.A flutter app is made of many widgets, its kind of a datatype.Text(),Icon() all this fuctions return a widget. 
6.Container has lots of advance properties like alignment and many other.
7.decoration keyword is used to decorate behind the child.BoxDecoration() fuction is used as value of key decoration.
8.decoration and color cannot be used at a same time in the same Container.
9.A container can accomodate only one child.
10.As we can use only one child in a container,we can use Layout widget as a child that takes many children and thus we can include many images etc
11.Column() can be used as a only child for Container as column has children key that can hold a list of widgets(children).

eg:-Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('Deliver features faster'),
    Text('Craft beautiful UIs'),
   ],
)
