We learnt about using google map and gps in the Apps
Theme of the app can be changed using theme property of MaterialApp() which uses Themedata class.
If a App wants to use Google services it needs a key/token that can be achieved through Google Cloud Platform.
GoogleMap() function is used to display map in the App.mapType property,initialCameraPosition
Add the API key to AndroidManifest.xml.
Use CameraPosition() function with target attribute that takes latitude and longitude of the desired location. 
geolocator package can be used to make use of our mobile gps sensor to get current location.GeoLocator() function is used
